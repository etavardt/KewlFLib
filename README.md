# KewlFLib
An Application Foundation Library for C++ (A work in progress)

## KewlF (The Kewl Framework)

    A platform independent C++ Object Oriented Application Framework.

## KewlFApp

	The test app class to ensure everything is OK.

## The Goal(s) of the KewlF Foudantion Library
### The Primary Goal
+ Provide an OOP means of Application development that is Platform Independent
### Other Goals:
+ Follow the K.I.S.S. Rule in all things.
+ Be versatile by allowing the user to choose how much of the Library's functionality they want to use.
+ Keep from using 3rd Party libraries for KewlF if we can, even though it may mean doing the same thing as them.

## TODO
+ Enhance our own KewlF Logger to be able to log to files custom formating if possible.
+ If and when STL can do stack-tracing utilize it in Exceptions
+ If and when STL implements string formmatting, utilize it instead of useing our own.
